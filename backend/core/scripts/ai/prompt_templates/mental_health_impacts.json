Your task is to identify evidence-based connections between foods and mental health outcomes based on their nutritional profile.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include relationships with scientific research support\n2. Ground each impact in specific nutrients or compounds\n3. Prioritize impacts with stronger evidence (human RCTs > cohort studies > animal studies)\n4. Include mechanistic explanations for each impact\n5. Rate strength and confidence separately (strength=magnitude of effect, confidence=quality of evidence)\n6. Include time frame (acute/immediate vs. cumulative/long-term)\n7. Cite relevant research with PubMed IDs or DOIs\n8. Be conservative - include fewer high-confidence impacts rather than many speculative ones\n9. Include both positive and negative impacts where evidence exists",
