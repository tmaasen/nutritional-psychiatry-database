    "reasoning": "Blueberries are primarily carbohydrate-rich fruits with negligible protein content, thus they do not provide significant amounts of tryptophan or tyrosine. They also lack vitamin D and EPA, as these are not typically found in fruits. Omega-3 ALA is present in trace amounts, as some fruits contain small quantities, but the value is low. Confidence ratings reflect the certainty based on existing nutritional databases and research."
