# Nutritional Psychiatry Dataset: Methodology

This document outlines the comprehensive methodology used to create the Nutritional Psychiatry Dataset. We aim for full transparency in our approaches to ensure scientific validity and reproducibility.

## Overview

The Nutritional Psychiatry Dataset combines data from multiple sources using a multi-phase approach:

1. **Foundation Data Collection**: USDA nutritional data as the base
2. **Schema Mapping & Transformation**: Converting to our comprehensive schema
3. **Data Gap Analysis**: Identifying missing brain-specific nutrients
4. **AI-Assisted Enrichment**: Filling gaps with machine learning predictions
5. **Literature-Based Validation**: Cross-checking with scientific research
6. **Expert Review**: Validation by subject matter experts
7. **Quality Scoring**: Assigning confidence ratings to all data points

## Data Sources

### USDA FoodData Central

[USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) serves as our primary data source for standard nutritional information. We use their Foundation Foods, SR Legacy, and Survey (FNDDS) databases, accessed via the FoodData Central API.

**Key considerations:**
- We prioritize Foundation Foods data when available
- Standard Release (SR) Legacy data is used as a backup
- We map USDA food categories to our simplified category system

### Scientific Literature

For brain-specific nutrients and mental health impacts not available in USDA data, we draw from:

- Peer-reviewed journal articles
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Reference databases for less common nutrients
- Brain-specific nutrition textbooks and references

All literature-derived data includes source citations and confidence ratings.

### AI-Assisted Generation

For nutrients and compounds where direct measurements are unavailable, we use AI models (primarily GPT-4) to generate predictions based on:

- Similar foods with known values
- Nutritional science principles
- Typical patterns in food composition
- Known relationships between nutrients

All AI-generated data is clearly marked and includes confidence ratings.

## Detailed Methodology by Component

### 1. USDA Data Collection

```python
# Key steps in our USDA collection script
def fetch_usda_data(food_id):
    # Fetch food details from FDC API
    # Extract nutrients and metadata
    # Save raw data for reproducibility
```

We collect:
- Food descriptions and categories
- Serving size information
- All available nutrients (~150 nutrients per food)
- Metadata on analytical methods and sample origins

### 2. Schema Transformation

```python
# Key steps in our transformation script
def transform_usda_to_schema(usda_data):
    # Map USDA nutrient IDs to our schema
    # Organize into our hierarchical structure
    # Convert units for consistency
    # Calculate derived metrics
```

We perform:
- Nutrient mapping from USDA IDs to our schema
- Unit conversions (e.g., IU to Î¼g for vitamins)
- Organization into logical categories
- Derivation of some values (e.g., nutrient ratios)

### 3. Brain Nutrient Enrichment

When brain-specific nutrients are missing, we use a multi-tiered approach:

1. **Literature search**: Find direct measurements in scientific papers
2. **Derivation from proxies**: Calculate from related nutrients when possible
3. **AI-assisted prediction**: Generate estimates based on similar foods

For AI-assisted predictions, we:
- Provide the model with complete nutrient profile
- Include food category and characteristics
- Ask for estimates with confidence levels
- Validate against known values when possible

Example prompt structure:
```
Based on nutritional science, predict the following missing brain-specific nutrients for [food name] (category: [category]).

The food has these standard nutrients (per 100g):
[standard nutrients]

Please predict values for:
- tryptophan_mg
- omega3.epa_mg
- ... [other missing nutrients]

Provide confidence levels and rationale.
```

### 4. Bioactive Compound Enrichment

For bioactive compounds:
1. **Literature-first approach**: Search specific studies measuring compounds
2. **Reference databases**: Use specialty databases for polyphenols, etc.
3. **AI prediction**: For foods with limited direct measurements

Confidence ratings are lower for bioactive compounds due to greater natural variability and fewer standardized measurements.

### 5. Mental Health Impact Attribution

Mental health impacts require the most rigorous approach:

1. **Systematic literature review**: Find clinical and preclinical studies
2. **Mechanistic analysis**: Document known pathways
3. **Evidence grading**: Rate strength based on study quality
4. **Consensus approach**: For conflicting evidence

When using AI to help identify impacts, we:
- Provide all known nutrients and compounds
- Request evidence-based mechanisms
- Require citations for all claimed effects
- Apply stricter validation criteria

### 6. Quality Scoring System

All data points include quality metrics:

1. **Completeness**: Percentage of schema fields with valid data
2. **Source reliability**: Based on source type and quality
   - Direct measurement: 8-10
   - Literature-derived: 6-8
   - AI-predicted with good confidence: 4-6
   - AI-predicted with low confidence: 1-3
3. **Impact confidence**: For mental health impacts
   - Based on study quality, replication, effect size
   - 1-10 scale with clear criteria
   - Requires multiple studies for scores above 7

### 7. Validation Procedures

Our validation process includes:

1. **Cross-reference checking**: Compare multiple sources
2. **Outlier detection**: Flag values outside expected ranges
3. **Consistency verification**: Check related nutrients for consistency
4. **Expert review**: Domain experts review a sample of foods
5. **User feedback**: Mechanism for community corrections

## Limitations and Considerations

We acknowledge several inherent limitations:

1. **Natural variability**: Nutrient content varies by growing conditions, preparation methods, etc.
2. **Missing data**: Some compounds have limited scientific measurement
3. **Emergent research**: Nutritional psychiatry is still evolving
4. **AI limitations**: Predictions are estimates and may contain errors
5. **Individual differences**: People respond differently to foods and nutrients

## Future Methodology Improvements

We plan to enhance our methodology through:

1. **Expanded direct measurements**: Partner with labs for key nutrients
2. **Improved AI models**: Train specialized models on nutritional data
3. **Bayesian confidence**: More sophisticated uncertainty quantification
4. **Personalization factors**: Account for demographic and genetic factors
5. **Temporal dynamics**: Account for nutrient interactions over time
