# AI Methodology for Nutritional Psychiatry Dataset Enrichment

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the artificial intelligence methodology used to enrich the Nutritional Psychiatry Dataset. The AI enrichment process addresses key data gaps in traditional food databases by predicting brain-specific nutrients, bioactive compounds, and mental health impacts based on scientific literature and established nutritional principles.

## 2. AI Enrichment Purpose and Rationale

### 2.1 Data Gap Challenge

Traditional food databases like the USDA FoodData Central provide excellent general nutritional information but have significant limitations for nutritional psychiatry applications:

1. **Missing brain-specific nutrients**: Many nutrients critical to brain function (tryptophan, tyrosine, specific omega-3 fractions) are inconsistently reported
2. **Absence of bioactive compounds**: Polyphenols, flavonoids, and other bioactive compounds with neurological effects are rarely included
3. **No mental health connections**: Standard databases do not map nutrition to mental health outcomes
4. **Limited nutrient interaction data**: Synergistic or antagonistic nutrient relationships are not captured

### 2.2 AI Solution Approach

Our AI methodology addresses these gaps through four key enrichment processes:

1. **Brain-nutrient prediction**: Estimates missing brain-relevant nutrients based on food composition patterns
2. **Bioactive compound prediction**: Predicts levels of neuroprotective compounds
3. **Mental health impact generation**: Creates evidence-based connections between nutrients and mental wellness
4. **Nutrient interaction identification**: Maps how nutrients work together to affect brain function

## 3. AI Enrichment Pipeline Architecture

The enrichment pipeline follows a structured process:

1. **Data preparation**: Food records from USDA and OpenFoodFacts are transformed to our schema
2. **Data gap analysis**: Missing brain-specific nutrients and compounds are identified
3. **AI enrichment**: Large language models predict missing values and relationships
4. **Confidence scoring**: Each prediction includes a confidence rating (1-10)
5. **Validation**: Predictions are validated against known values and literature
6. **Confidence calibration**: Ratings are calibrated based on validation results
7. **Quality control**: Final enriched data is checked against validation rules

## 4. AI Models and Parameters

### 4.1 Model Selection

The primary model used for enrichment is GPT-4, chosen for its:

- Superior reasoning capabilities for scientific data
- Strong performance on numerical tasks
- Ability to synthesize scientific literature knowledge
- Robust response to complex, multi-step prompts

For fallback scenarios or simpler enrichment tasks, GPT-3.5-Turbo is used to optimize cost and processing time.

### 4.2 Parameter Configuration

Model parameters are optimized for each specific task:

- **Temperature**: Set to 0.2-0.3 (low) for fact-based nutrient predictions to maximize accuracy and consistency
- **Token limits**: Sufficient context window to include food details, existing nutrients, and scientific context
- **Response format**: Structured JSON format with explicit confidence ratings
- **Seed value**: Fixed for reproducibility in validation scenarios

## 5. Prompt Engineering for Nutritional Data

### 5.1 Prompt Template Structure

All prompts follow a consistent structure:

1. **System prompt**: Defines expert role and scientific guidelines
2. **Food identity**: Name and category information
3. **Existing nutrient profile**: Standard and known brain nutrients
4. **Task specification**: Clear instructions for prediction targets
5. **Scientific context**: Additional research information when available
6. **Output format**: Structured JSON specification with examples
7. **Validation guidance**: Rules for ensuring biological plausibility

### 5.2 Expertise Framing

Prompts are framed to invoke specific scientific expertise:

- "Nutritional biochemistry expert specializing in brain-relevant nutrients"
- "Phytochemistry expert focusing on bioactive compounds and neurological effects"
- "Nutritional psychiatry researcher specializing in food-mood relationships"

### 5.3 Scientific Guardrails

Prompts include explicit scientific constraints:

- Ensuring predicted values fall within biologically plausible ranges
- Requiring mechanistic explanations for all predictions
- Mandating confidence ratings that reflect evidence quality
- Enforcing appropriate values for food categories (e.g., no B12 in plant foods)
- Requiring literature citations for mental health impact claims

## 6. Task-Specific Methodologies

### 6.1 Brain Nutrient Prediction

The brain nutrient prediction methodology:

1. Analyzes the food's standard nutrient profile
2. Applies known nutritional relationships (e.g., tryptophan as ~1% of protein)
3. Considers food category patterns (e.g., fatty fish omega-3 profiles)
4. Accounts for bioavailability and nutrient interactions
5. Generates predictions with confidence ratings
6. Provides reasoning for each prediction

**Example nutrients predicted:**
- Tryptophan (serotonin precursor)
- Tyrosine (dopamine precursor)
- Specific omega-3 fractions (EPA, DHA, ALA)
- B vitamins (B6, B12, folate)
- Minerals (zinc, magnesium, iron, selenium)
- Choline

### 6.2 Bioactive Compound Prediction

For bioactive compounds:

1. Identifies compounds relevant to the specific food category
2. Predicts levels based on similar foods and research literature
3. Considers processing methods and their effect on compounds
4. Accounts for seasonal and varietal variations
5. Assigns appropriate confidence ratings

**Example compounds predicted:**
- Total polyphenols
- Flavonoids
- Anthocyanins
- Carotenoids
- Probiotics (for fermented foods)
- Prebiotic fiber

### 6.3 Mental Health Impact Generation

Mental health impact generation:

1. Analyzes the complete nutrient profile (standard, brain, bioactive)
2. Identifies nutrient patterns with established mental health effects
3. Generates impact descriptions with specific mechanisms of action
4. Assigns impact strength and confidence ratings based on evidence quality
5. Specifies timing effects (acute vs. cumulative)
6. Provides literature citations for each impact

**Example impacts generated:**
- Mood elevation/depression
- Anxiety reduction/increase
- Cognitive enhancement/decline
- Energy level effects
- Stress response modulation
- Sleep improvement

### 6.4 Nutrient Interaction Identification

To identify nutrient interactions:

1. Analyzes combinations of nutrients present in the food
2. Identifies established synergistic or antagonistic relationships
3. Explains biochemical mechanisms for the interaction
4. Describes how the interaction affects mental health outcomes
5. Assigns confidence ratings based on evidence quality
6. Provides literature citations

**Example interactions identified:**
- Vitamin E protecting omega-3s from oxidation
- Iron and vitamin C absorption synergy
- Zinc and copper antagonism
- Calcium and magnesium balance effects
- B-vitamin cofactor relationships

## 7. Quality Control Systems

### 7.1 Confidence Calibration System

The confidence calibration system ensures accuracy of confidence ratings:

1. AI initially assigns confidence scores (1-10) to all predictions
2. Known-answer testing compares predictions to reference values
3. Confidence calibration model adjusts ratings based on:
   - Nutrient-specific accuracy patterns
   - Food category-specific patterns
   - Overall model tendencies (e.g., overconfidence correction)
4. Global calibration factors are applied to the entire dataset

### 7.2 Known-Answer Testing

The known-answer testing methodology:

1. Uses a subset of foods with complete, high-quality reference data
2. Compares AI predictions to known values for each nutrient
3. Calculates accuracy metrics (% error, % within range)
4. Identifies nutrients with higher or lower prediction reliability
5. Creates a calibration model based on accuracy patterns
6. Generates performance reports for continuous improvement

### 7.3 Validation Rules

Comprehensive validation rules ensure scientific validity:

1. **Nutrient plausibility**: Values must fall within biologically plausible ranges
2. **Nutrient relationships**: Relationships between nutrients must be maintained (e.g., tryptophan as % of protein)
3. **Food category constraints**: Plant foods should have 0 B12 unless fortified
4. **Confidence-evidence alignment**: Higher confidence ratings require stronger evidence
5. **Citation requirements**: Mental health impacts require literature citations
6. **Mechanism specification**: All impacts require clear biological mechanisms
