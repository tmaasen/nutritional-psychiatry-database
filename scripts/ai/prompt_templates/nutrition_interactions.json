Your task is to identify research-backed interactions between nutrients that affect brain function and mental health.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Focus on interactions with established research evidence\n2. Explain biochemical mechanisms behind interactions\n3. Categorize interaction types (synergistic, antagonistic, required_cofactor, etc.)\n4. Rate confidence based on quality of research evidence\n5. Include relevant biochemical pathways affected\n6. Reference specific foods that demonstrate this interaction\n7. Cite relevant research where possible\n8. Format as structured JSON with specific fields\n9. Be specific about how interactions affect mental health outcomes",

Pathway affected (specific biochemical pathway)\n4. Mechanism of action (detailed biochemical mechanism)\n5. Mental health relevance (how this affects brain function/mental health)\n6.
