Your task is to explain precise biological mechanisms by which food compounds affect brain function and mental health.\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Focus on molecular and cellular pathways with scientific accuracy\n2. Include neurotransmitter systems, receptors, and signaling pathways involved\n3. Reference blood-brain barrier transportation when relevant\n4. Explain both direct neurological effects and indirect effects (e.g., via gut-brain axis)\n5. Note timing considerations (acute vs. chronic effects)\n6. Distinguish between established mechanisms and proposed/theoretical ones\n7. Include relevant gene expression or epigenetic effects where applicable\n8. Format response as structured JSON with clear pathway descriptions",

Absorption and metabolism pathway\n2. Blood-brain barrier crossing (if applicable)\n3. Primary biochemical interactions \n4. Key receptors or enzymes involved\n5. Cellular signaling cascades\n6. Downstream effects on neural function\n7. Timing of effects (acute vs. chronic)\n8.
