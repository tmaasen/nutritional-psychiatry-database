## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
Generate a visually striking, modern, and highly polished website **design**. Prioritize aesthetics, creative layout, sophisticated styling, and smooth micro-interactions. Structure the code with good **separation of concerns** to facilitate future development, even though functionality is secondary in this phase.

---

## MODULE 1: OVERALL THEME & MOOD
*   **Describe the core feeling:** `Minimalist & Sophisticated,Clean & Trustworthy`
*   **Visual Inspiration (Optional):** `brutalist web design elements`

---

## MODULE 2: LAYOUT & SPACING
*   **Layout Approach:** `Asymmetrical grid, Standard centered content within full-width sections`
*   **Section Separation:** `Seamless transitions`
*   **Content Width:** `Mostly contained width (max-w-screen-xl)`
*   **Spacing Scale (Whitespace):** `Standard Tailwind spacing`

---

## MODULE 3: COLOR PALETTE
Use your expert design skills to come up with the color palette. Here are some examples:
*   **Background (Base):** `[e.g., "#FFFFFF", "#1A1A1A (Dark)", "#F8F8F8 (Off-white)"]`
*   **Text (Base):** `[e.g., "#111827 (Near Black)", "#E5E7EB (Light Gray for dark mode)"]`
*   **Primary Accent / Brand Color:** `[e.g., "#3B82F6 (Blue)", "#EC4899 (Pink)", "Electric Blue (#00FFFF)"]` (Used for CTAs, highlights)
*   **Secondary Accent (Optional):** `[e.g., "#10B981 (Green)", "#F59E0B (Amber)"]` (Used for secondary buttons, tags, icons)
*   **Gradient Usage (Optional):** `[e.g., "Subtle gradients on buttons", "Hero background gradient from #FF00FF to #00FFFF", "No gradients"]`
*   *(Specify Hex/RGB/HSL codes for precision. Describe general usage if needed.)*

## MODULE 4: TYPOGRAPHY
Use your expert design skills to come up with the typography. Here are some examples:
*   **Headline Font:** `[e.g., "Geist Sans (Default)", "Serif (e.g., Playfair Display)", "Monospace (e.g., JetBrains Mono)"]`
    *   **Headline Style:** `[e.g., "Bold weight", "Large size", "Uppercase", "Letter spacing: wide"]`
*   **Body Font:** `[e.g., "Geist Sans (Default)", "Clean Sans-Serif (e.g., Inter)"]`
    *   **Body Style:** `[e.g., "Normal weight", "Readable size (text-base)", "Line height: relaxed"]`
*   **Hierarchy:** `[e.g., "Strong visual hierarchy using size and weight", "Minimalist hierarchy"]`

---

## MODULE 5: IMAGERY & ICONS
*   **Image Style:** Use stock photos, but describe the intended style: `High-quality lifestyle photos`
*   **Icon Style (lucide-react):** `Standard stroke width, Consistent size (e.g., size={20})`

---

## MODULE 6: INTERACTIVITY & ANIMATION (Visual Focus)
*   **Hover Effects:** `Subtle scale/brightness changes on cards/buttons, Underline effects on links`
*   **Scroll Animations:** `No scroll animations`
*   **Button Interactions:** `Clear visual feedback on click (scale down/color change)`
*   **Loading States (Visual Only):** `Basic loading spinner`

---

## MODULE 7: FILE STRUCTURE & COMPONENT STRATEGY (Separation of Concerns)
*   **Goal:** Structure the code for maintainability and easier future integration with logic/data.
*   **Directory Structure:** Organize components logically within `components/`.
*   **Component Granularity:** Break down large page sections (from Module 9) into smaller, focused components.
*   **Client Components:** Add `'use client'` directive *only* where essential for visual interactivity (e.g., mobile menu toggle, visual carousels, accordions). Keep structural components as Server Components where possible.
*   **Props:** Define clear `interface` or `type` for component props (even with placeholder data) to establish component contracts.

---

## MODULE 8: COMPONENT STYLING NOTES (Optional Specifics)
*   **Buttons (shadcn/ui):** `Sharp corners (no border-radius)`
*   **Inputs (Placeholders):** `Minimalist underline style`

---

## MODULE 9: REQUIRED VISUAL SECTIONS (Implement Using Above Styles & Structure):
Generate visually distinct components for each section below, following the structure strategy defined in Module 7. Ensure cohesive design based on Modules 1-6. Use placeholder text and links (`#`).

Navigation Bar:
Design header (sticky/fixed) with Nutritional Psychiatry Database logo, menu links (Home, Food Database, Research, Resources, Contact), and a "Search Foods" button. Include a brain icon in the logo design. Ensure mobile responsive design with appropriate menu trigger.
Hero Section:
Design an impactful introduction with headline focusing on "Connecting Food, Brain Health, and Mental Wellness," supporting subheading about evidence-based food-mood connections, and primary CTA button "Explore the Database." Include a visually appealing graphic showing the food-brain-mood connection (could include brain illustration with food elements). Add metrics about "5000+ Foods," "200+ Brain Nutrients Tracked," and "Evidence-Based Mental Health Impacts."
Features Representation:
Design feature showcase highlighting: "Comprehensive Brain Nutrient Profiles" (with Brain icon), "Mental Health Impact Analysis" (with Mood icon), "Food Comparison Tools" (with Balance icon), and "Scientific Evidence Ratings" (with Research icon). Each with brief description of how the feature helps understand nutrition's role in mental health.
"How It Works" / Process Visualization:
Design 3-step process showing: "1. Search Foods" (with Search icon), "2. Explore Brain Nutrients" (with Nutrient icon), "3. Understand Mental Health Connections" (with Connection icon). Include database screenshots at each step.
Database Showcase Visual:
Design showcase section featuring actual UI screenshots from the database application, highlighting the food detail view, brain nutrient panels, and food comparison tool. Include caption explaining how the interface helps users explore food-mood relationships.
Access Tiers:
Design 3 distinct access options: "Basic Access" (free, limited searches), "Professional" (full database access, ideal for healthcare providers), and "Research" (including API access, designed for academic researchers). Highlight the Professional tier.
Expert Endorsements:
Design section featuring testimonials from nutritional psychiatry researchers, dietitians, and mental health professionals about the value of this database for understanding food-brain connections. Include professional headshots and credentials.
FAQ Section:
Style accordion with questions like: "What is nutritional psychiatry?", "How accurate is the nutrient data?", "What sources does the database use?", "How are mental health impacts determined?", "Can I contribute research to the database?", "How often is the database updated?"
Research Partnership CTA:
Design a compelling section inviting researchers to contribute or collaborate, with headline "Advancing Nutritional Psychiatry Research Together" and prominent "Partner With Us" button, optional email subscription for research updates.
Footer:
Design organized footer with columns for: About (project mission, team), Resources (research papers, methodology), Data (sources, APIs, updates), Legal (terms, privacy), and Contact information. Include acknowledgments for data sources (USDA, OpenFoodFacts, scientific literature).
Data Visualization Section (Bonus):
Design an engaging section showcasing interactive charts comparing nutrients across food categories and their relationship to different mental health outcomes. Include a "View Full Analytics" CTA.
Scientific Methodology Section (Bonus):
Design a brief overview of the AI-assisted methodology used to predict brain nutrients and mental health impacts, with confidence rating visualization and link to full methodology documentation.

## MODULE 10: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (For v0):
*   Generate within a single `<CodeProject id="[product-name]-visual-design-structured">`.
*   Use `tsx` files, kebab-case filenames.
*   Use **shadcn/ui** components as a base, style heavily via **Tailwind CSS**.
*   Use **`lucide-react`** for icons.
*   Implement **responsive design** visually.
*   Ensure basic **accessibility** structure (semantic HTML).
*   **Structure:** Follow the separation of concerns strategy outlined in Module 7 (directory structure, component granularity, `'use client'` placement, prop types).
*   Use placeholder data/links (`#`, `Lorem Ipsum`). **No functional logic needed.**
*   Use `import type` for type imports.
